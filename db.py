"""Postgres layer for ParentBot.

ParentBot is the one process in the family that reads *across* schemas. It
owns `parent_bot.*` (just its own activity log, so the same /status
machinery as every other bot works here too), it reads and writes
`family.*` (heartbeats, events, the command queue -- created by
family_link.py, which every bot in the family carries), and it reads the
four public bots' schemas to answer "how many users has ConvertBot had this
week" without going anywhere near their processes.

Read-only across other bots' schemas, deliberately -- ParentBot never
writes into a bot's own tables. When something needs changing inside a bot,
it goes through the family command queue so that bot does it itself, with
its own code and its own invariants.

# Two ways of pointing a bot at a cloud Postgres fail *quietly* rather than

#
#   Transaction pooling -- Supabase/Supavisor on port 6543, or PgBouncer in
#   transaction mode -- multiplexes many clients over a few server
#   connections, so per-connection startup options do not survive from one
#   transaction to the next. The pool below passes search_path as exactly
#   such an option, which means the bot would read and write "public"
#   instead of its own schema, while still heartbeating perfectly. That
#   surfaces as wrong data rather than as a broken bot, which is the worst
#   way to find out. The session pooler (port 5432) keeps one server
#   connection per client and is the right one here.
#
#   An unencoded "@" or ":" in the password splits the URL in the wrong
#   place, so libpq ends up resolving a hostname that is really the tail of
#   the password -- a DNS error that says nothing about the real cause.
#
# These warn rather than refuse: an unusual setup is the owner's business,
# and a bot that will not start is worse than one that says why it might
